BiBTeX data base for knowledge space theory texts

In general, I use first_author:year as citation labels for articles,
first_author:first_editor for incollections, first_author:conference
for conference papers and author:thesistype for all kinds of theses.
If necessary, a letter (in alphabetical order) is added for
uniqueness of articles. Books and techreports/mnuals are marked with a `b'
or a `tr', respectively, between colon and year. For R packages, the
label is first_author:package_abbreviation_in_lowercase.

abstract="In knowledge space theory, existing adaptive assessment procedures can only be applied when suitable estimates of their parameters are available. In this paper, an iterative procedure is proposed, which upgrades its parameters with the increasing number of assessments. The first assessments are run using parameter values that favor accuracy over efficiency. Subsequent assessments are run using new parameter values estimated on the incomplete response patterns from previous assessments. Parameter estimation is carried out through a new probabilistic model for missing-at-random data. Two simulation studies show that, with the increasing number of assessments, the performance of the proposed procedure approaches that of gold standards.",

abstract ={In the framework of knowledge space theory, prerequisite
relationships between learning objectives from a knowledge domain are
obtained from experts' judgments. The validity of these prerequisite
relationships is tested by comparing them to students' test data.
Thereby, the experts' judgments can differ from each other, and the
students' data can contradict the experts' prerequisite relationships.
We suggest coefficients for detecting the inconsistencies and
invalidities, and evaluate these coefficients in two simulation
studies. The performance of two of the coefficients can be shown to be
efficient, whereas the results for the validity coefficients are not
yet promising.}

	abstract={Abstract Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA) is a set of practices for architectural design of software that exploits services as loosely coupled components orchestrated to deliver various functionalities. The SOA paradigm is not well established in the Serious Games (SG) domain, but it is expected to provide benefits, particularly in reducing the conceptual and technological complexity of the development. In this paper, we propose and study the application of a SOA approach to SG development. We have used the SOA approach to develop an adaptive Serious Game for teaching basic elements of probability to high school and entry-level university students, called The Journey. Details of the architecture implementation are offered, as well as the results of an evaluation of the system using the Architecture Tradeoff Analysis Method (ATAM). Based on our experience, we argue that the SOA approach can make SG development shorter, more flexible and more focused.},

abstract="One of the most crucial issues in knowledge space theory is the construction of the so-called knowledge structures. In the present paper, a new data-driven procedure for large data sets is described, which overcomes some of the drawbacks of the already existing methods. The procedure, called k-states, is an incremental extension of the k-modes algorithm, which generates a sequence of locally optimal knowledge structures of increasing size, among which a ``best'' model is selected. The performance of k-states is compared to other two procedures in both a simulation study and an empirical application. In the former, k-states displays a better accuracy in reconstructing knowledge structures; in the latter, the structure extracted by k-states obtained a better fit.",

abstract={ A knowledge space is a structure for representing prerequisite
relationships between items from a specified branch of knowledge.
These relationships can be applied to assess students' knowledge
adaptively.  These prerequisite relationships are obtained by
querying experts. Very often, however, the experts' opinions on
these prerequisite relationships differ. One suggestion to deal
with this problem is to consider only those relationships on which
the majority of the experts agree. A straightforward algorithm for
computing these majority relationships is given.
This procedure does, however, have the
disadvantage that the intersection of knowledge spaces has to be
computed, which has turned out to be very large in practice. We solve
this problem with procedure, that computes this
intersection using only the bases of the knowledge spaces considered.

The results of this paper can be applied to construct efficient

The problem of knowledge assessment is a special case of the
problem of assessing the state of a system. These results are
obtained suggesting a new assessment algorithm whose formal
equivalence to previously suggested assessment algorithms is
proven. A simulation study illustrates the vast improvements
of efficiency with the new algorithm.

In this paper, we suggest methods for the adaptive assessment

training. We also describe improvements of existing assessment
algorithms. These ideas are implemented in a multi--platform tutoring

knowledge.

The collection of all knowledge states conceivable for a given

purposes, it is useful to combine knowledge
structures  covering only a limited part of a domain, into bigger, more

abstract={Doignon und Falmagne haben das Modell der Wissensr{\"a}ume entwickelt,
die eine effiziente, qualitative Wissensdiagnose in
abgegrenzten Wissensgebieten erm{\"o}glichen. Die von ihnen
vorgeschlagenen Diagnosealgorithmen haben allerdings einen hohen
Speicher-- und Rechenzeitbedarf.
In der vorliegenden Arbeit wird ein weniger speicher-- und
rechenzeitintensiver Diagnosealgorithmus vorgestellt, der auf der
Basis eines Wissensraumes arbeitet.
Es wird ein allgemeiner Formalismus zur Beschreibung von
Wissensdiagnosen definiert. Auf der Grundlage dieser allgemeinen
Diagnosenrepr{\"a}sentation wird die Klasse der redundanzfreien
Diagnoseautomaten als Teilmenge der Klasse der endlichen, erkennenden
Automaten beschrieben.
Es wird gezeigt, da{\ss} der raumorientierte Algorithmus von Doignon \&
Falmagne und der neuentwickelte basisorientierte Algorithmus Beispiele
redundanzfreier Diagnoseautomaten sind. 
Die beiden Algorithmen werden mit Hilfe von Simulationen auf empirisch
gewonnenen Wissensr{\"a}umen verglichen.
{\par}
Doignon and Falmagne have developed knowledge space theory for the
qualitative assessment of knowledge in fixed domains. Their
assessment algorithm, however, requires a large amount of computer
memory and processor time. 
In this thesis another assessment algorithm is presented which
operates on the representation of a knowledge space's basis and therefore
needs less memory and computing time.
A formal description of knowledge assessments is given as a
foundation for defining non--redundant assessment machines, a specific
type of finite automata.
It is proven that the space oriented assessment algorithm
developed by Doignon \& Falmagne and the new, base oriented algorithm
are both examples for non--redundant assessment machines.
The two assessment algorithms are compared simulating students' data
and using empirically determined knowledge spaces.

Fringe of a Knowledge State},

abstract={
Doignon and Falmagne have developed the concept of the fringe of a
knowledge state based upon the neighbourhood of knowledge states. This
concept is useful for probabilistic assessment of knowledge and for
the suggestion of training problems in an intelligent tutoring system.
In this paper, a generalized definition of the fringe of knowledge
states is introduced.
An efficient procedure is presented which computes the fringe of
knowledge states using the basis of a knowledge space. In a simulation
study, this procedure is compared with the approach described by
Doignon and Falmagne.

abstract={The theory of knowledge spaces provides means of
representing and processing expert's knowledge in computer based
systems.  Dowling introduces a procedure relying on this theory for 
querying experts without redundancy.
This thesis presents an implementation of Dowling's algorithm 
designed to be efficient and easily ported to different computers. 
Care has been taken to allow adaption to foreign languages, different 
domains of knowledge and new querying strategies (almost) without 
effort. 
In the area of finding irredundant questions the former check
for redundancy requiring exponentially increasing computing time could 
be replaced by a constructive procedure generating the set of 
irredundant questions.
Some querying strategies are compared in a simulation study with 
respect to the number of questions being asked.

	year="2018",
	month="Nov",
	day="12",
	abstract="Knowledge space theory (KST) structures are introduced within item response theory (IRT) as a possible way to model local dependence between items. The aim of this paper is threefold: firstly, to generalize the usual characterization of local independence without introducing new parameters; secondly, to merge the information provided by the IRT and KST perspectives; and thirdly, to contribute to the literature that bridges continuous and discrete theories of assessment. In detail, connections are established between the KST simple learning model (SLM) and the IRT General Graded Response Model, and between the KST Basic Local Independence Model and IRT models in general. As a consequence, local independence is generalized to account for the existence of prerequisite relations between the items, IRT models become a subset of KST models, IRT likelihood functions can be generalized to broader families, and the issues of local dependence and dimensionality are partially disentangled. Models are discussed for both dichotomous and polytomous items and conclusions are drawn on their interpretation. Considerations on possible consequences in terms of model identifiability and estimation procedures are also provided.",

		 knowledge space theory (KST). In Chapter 2, the main
		 deterministic and probabilistic concepts of KST are
		 introduced. The data analysis methods, Inductive item
		 tree analysis (IITA) and its two enhancements,
		 corrected and minimized corrected IITA, are thoroughly
		 discussed. The IITA algorithms are compared in two
		 simulation studies and with real datasets. We introduce
		 maximum likelihood methodology for the IITA methods. It
		 is shown that these fit measures have several
		 asymptotic quality properties. The R package DAKS is
		 presented, and the use of the package's functions are
		 illustrated with examples. Finally, important
		 directions for future research are presented.; Die
		 vorliegende Arbeit besch{\"a}ftigt sich mit
		 datenanalytischen Verfahren in der Wissensraumtheorie.
		 Es werden die deterministischen und stochastischen
		 Grundlagen der Wissensraumtheorie eingef{\"u}hrt und
		 datenanalytische Verfahren analysiert. Schwerpunkt
		 hierbei sind die drei Inductive Item Tree Analysis
		 (IITA) Algorithmen, wobei zwei im Rahmen dieser

		 IITA-Verfahren werden in Simulationsstudien und anhand
		 von realen Daten verglichen. Es wird Maximum-Likelihood

abstract="The methodologies for the construction of a knowledge structure mainly refer to the query to experts, the skill maps, and the data-driven approaches. This last method is of growing interest in recent literature. In this paper, an iterative procedure for building a skill map from a set of data is introduced. This procedure is based on the minimization of the distance between the knowledge structure delineated by a given skill map and the data. The accuracy of the proposed method is tested through a number of simulation studies where the amount of noise in the data is manipulated as well as the kind of structure to be reconstructed. Results show that the procedure is accurate and that its performance tends to be sufficiently stable even with high error rates. The procedure is compared to two already-existing methodologies to derive knowledge structures from a set of data. The use of the corrected Akaike Information Criterion (AICc) as a stopping criterion of the iterative reconstruction procedure is tested against the app criterion introduced by Schrepp. Moreover, two empirical applications on clinical data are reported, and their results show the applicability of the procedure.",

	abstract={This article presents two current research trends in e-learning that at first sight appear to compete. Competence-Based Knowledge Space Theory (CBKST) provides a knowledge representation framework which, since its invention by Doignon & Falmagne, has been successfully applied in various e-learning systems (for example, Adaptive Learning with Knowledge Spaces [ALEKS] and Enhanced Learning Experience and Knowledge Transfer [ELEKTRA]), providing automated personalisation to learners' current knowledge and competence levels. Principles of self-regulated learning (SRL), pioneered by, for example, Zimmerman, however, argue for increased learner control, thus resulting in giving learners greater responsibility over their e-learning. The research presented in this article shows that skill-based visualisations in the tradition of CBKST and SRL-based autonomy are in no way conflicting but rather complement each other towards an integrated approach of self-regulated personalised learning. The research has been carried out and technologically translated into a set of visual tools for supporting the whole learning cycle within the scope of the iClass project.},
