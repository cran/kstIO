Description: Knowledge space theory by Doignon and Falmagne (1999) 
   <doi:10.1007/978-3-642-58625-5> is a set- and order-theoretical
   framework which proposes mathematical formalisms to operationalize 
   knowledge structures in a particular domain.  The 'kstIO' package 
   provides basic functionalities to read and write KST data from/to 
   files to be used together with the 'kst', 'kstMatrix', 'pks' or 
   'DAKS' packages.
